# SmallAreaMixedEffectsQuantiles
## Code for small area estimation based on the mixed effects linearly interpolated generalized Pareto distribution
### Main simulation programs: The following programs produce output similar to the simulation output in the manuscript.
* No transformation (Section 4.1): SimForOrganizedCodeAttempt2.R
* With transformation (Section 4.2): SimForOrganizedCodeAttempt2TestTransform.R
### Verification code and output
#### To allow the user to verify that the code is working as expected, we saved a test data set in the folder "TestDataSets." Output from applying the procedure to the test data set is saved in the excel file "SampleDataSetOutput.xlsx."
* The program "CodeToCompareToTestDataSets.R" reproduces the output in "SampleDataSetOutput.xlsx."
